But, of course, when I went there to Bosnia, how would I have known that our leaders will be Jemaah Islamiyah, Egyptian Jemaah Islamiyah who actually killed Sadat in 1981 because of the fact that he signed the peace treaty with Israel. So, of course, they were the enemies of peace. But I did not know that. I was only sixteen. I went there thinking I was going to do something noble. And this is the problem, is that you have a noble cause, but then it's led by the wrong leaders who basically use it in order to manufacture a narrative that there is a greater conflict. For me, now with hindsight years, he is later, I realised that the Serbs were fighting a nationalist war. Yes, they cloaked their nationalistic cause with Christian symbology. But it was enough to fool the naive young men from the Arab world who came to fight in Bosnia that it is a crusade. And they then turned their hatred against America, because they believed, by the end of the war that the Americans are rewarded the Serbs with half of the Bosnian territory, even though there were only one third of the population. You know, they rewarded their genocide by having this in a half-baked peace treaty between the two – the three sides—the Bosnians, the Serbs, and the Croats. So, how Khalid Sheikh Mohammed—we come back again to him—the architect of 9/11, when he arrived in Bosnia, just only, you know, several weeks before the date and agreement was signed, he was telling us that the conflict is about to end, because, already, the negotiations are taking place. There is a truce. There is a ceasefire. \"And remember brothers—.\" I remember his words. He said, \"Remember, brothers. Why do we allow the Americans and other world powers to dictate where we fight? Why are we running from one fringe conflict on the fringes of the Muslim world from a Bosnia to a Chechnya to a Kashmir, and we keep fighting in these conflicts and we leave the centre? It's the centre of the Muslim world that is so weak that actually allowed the fringes of the Muslim world to suffer so greatly in these conflicts. So, we need to reclaim the centre, reshape the centre, remake the centre, and recreate the glories of the Muslim caliphate.\", episode_id=1)\n",
